What do I want or understand better?
 Am getting better with the tools that we are using in the project,though I would like to even be better.

How can I help someone else or the entire team to learn something new?
In case there is anything that the team is unsure of, I can check in the litteratur to come up with some situations.


What's my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
contribute to adding on user stories and help the team follow the scrum workflow.

What are my contributions towards the team's deliveries?
I am working on the user stories assigned to me and making sure that they are finished in the planned time so that the team doesn't not lag behind.
